\chapter{RSS World Cup Ranking and Latest Odds}

There are a number of ranking systems around at the moment which include the
FIFA World Ranking which the majority of RSS subscribers think is patently 
ridiculous, and a ranking which is compiled by European journalists on a 
regular basis. They do this by each producing a top ten of the 24 World Cup
qualifiers and scoring ten points for a first rank down to 1 point for a tenth
rank. In April, I decided to do something similar on RSS - I thought it would
be a more accurate reflection as we have a wider variety of nations represented
and it would also have a large enough number of voters to give some meaning to
the results, so below is the fan's World Cup ranking and alongside it are the 
latest odds to win the World Cup available in the UK.
